# React.js Based Font-End

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Requirements
Apart from React, we make use of
- Semantic-UI React
- Helmet
- lodash

Ensure to install the required npm packages before using the code.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
### `npm test`
### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
